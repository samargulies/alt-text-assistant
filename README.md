media-ally
==========

A WordPress plugin to create an accessibility report for media files.

The initial version provides a list of images without alt text in Settings &rarr; Accessibility Report. It also offers an option to turn on an 'Alt/Transcript' column in the Media Library, where you will see either a check mark or a link to add alt text.

Other forms of media will be added in future versions.
